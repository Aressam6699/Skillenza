<h1> Our Product : Eruditio</h1>
Our Idea is catered towards education technologies. As students ourselves we aim to tackle some problems that we face first-hand and provide novel solutions for the same.
The course material that is presented to students worldwide, specially to students in higher classes or colleges, is often non indulging and monotonous. It has hardly any interactability and often does not drive the student towards further reading on the topics.

We aim to tackle that problem and provide a platform that not only makes the material taught to students easier to understand, but also provides features that encourage additional learning.
Through simple material uploaded by the students, such as an audio/ video recording of the lecture, its Transcript, or even parts of texts from their coursebook. We aim to provide a system that not only Effectively summarizes the material for the students

In the recent scenario where the threat of COVID-19 hangs on all of us. Most of the institutions are in a state of shut down, with most of the classes being taken online. In this case it gets very difficult for the teachers and students to get the same level of interactibility and understanding that they wold get from an in person lecture. Our idea proves to be highly useful in this particular scenario as even an upload of the lecture transcript by the teacher gives the students a lot better understanding than they would have gotten just from reading it and it also reduces the load on the teacher as they do not have to prepare every component separately.

# Highlighting our main Advantages:
Keyword extraction as well as links alongside them that allow the user to browse the current advancements going on in the field as well as helpful material for easier understanding.
Powerpoint generation that may help not only students to have the data in an easier to understand form but also teachers who are preparing for a lecture.
A system to generate or link to quizzes on the important topics presented in the material so student could test their understanding and better prepare? Identify weak points.
A forum that users may use to discuss doubts on a certain subject with special benefits to teachers who volunteer as experts.
A chatbot to easily browse and answer question available directly in the material
Flash cards for quick revision
Finally a platform where users can personalize their notes based on what they deem important.
